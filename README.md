# ðŸš¦ Pedestrian Traffic Light Controller (Verilog HDL)

A finite state machine (FSM) designed in Verilog HDL to control a pedestrian-activated traffic light system.

## ðŸ”„ Features
- Push-button activated pedestrian crossing
- Time-based FSM with reset state
- Red/Green/Yellow LED control logic

## ðŸ”§ Technologies
- Verilog HDL, FSM, ModelSim, Quartus Prime
- Testbench and waveform analysis

## ðŸ§  My Role
- Project leader (3-member team)
- FSM design and Verilog coding
- Testbench writing & waveform simulation
